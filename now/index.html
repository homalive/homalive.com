    <p>Many folks ask what Homalive is up to. But because we’re razor focused on our pilot customers right now, we don’t write much about ourselves. To keep everyone in the loop, here’s a little <a target="_blank" href="https://sivers.org/nowff">/now page</a> about us right now. No fluff, simple and concrete, 100% transparency.</p>
    <p>The last update was on September 3rd, 2018.</p>
    <h2><a id="what-drives-us"></a>what drives us <span aria-role="img" class="emoji">🚀</span></h2>
    <p>We think everyone should live and work in a space with character. But for many projects, hiring a good architect is too difficult or too expensive. Technology comes to the rescue!</p>
    <h2><a id="the-world-were-building"></a>the world we’re building <span aria-role="img" class="emoji">🌏</span></h2>
    <p>Today architecture is a craft (like super expensive handmade cars). We want to turn it into a product (like much less expensive mass production cars).</p>
    <p>Think it might kill quality? Well, most mass products we know are of amazing quality. Think about smartphones or cars in the streets.</p>
    <p>Think it might kill architecture jobs? For sure it will change how architecture is developed. But since demand for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.economicmodeling.com/2017/01/12/data-spotlight-fierce-demand-uiux-designers/">product designers</a> is booming, we’re sure it will boom for “product architects” too.</p>
    <p>Think it might kill individuality? That’s where our AI software comes into play!</p>
    <h2><a id="what-we-have-already"></a>what we have already <span aria-role="img" class="emoji">🙌</span></h2>
    <p>A working prototype of ”AI architect”. It’s an easy to use app that allows ordinary folks to configure an architectural space to suit their needs. Whether it’s their home, their office or a real estate investment.</p>
    <p>They get instant feedback on things that matter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>will the kitchen be easy to use?</li>
        <li>does this meet all necessary regulations?</li>
        <li>is this corridor wide enough?</li>
        <li>how much will construction cost?</li>
        <li>what might heating cost monthly?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have a rough prototype of how the software integrates with existing tools. An integration with cadwork will directly drive <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thoma.at/construction-progress/?lang=en">production</a>, without manual CAM preparation. An integration with Autodesk Revit will generate detailed documentation and all necessary paperwork.</p>
    <p>But first of all, we have a bunch of interested customers. Much more than we thought we would have without any kind of spreading the word!</p>
    <h2><a id="markets-we-want-to-enter"></a>markets we want to enter <span aria-role="img" class="emoji">⚡️</span></h2>
    <p>Our AI software that integrates with production systems works great with many different kinds of buildings, but we want to focus on one at a time. We’re considering three markets. Let’s see which one turns out most exciting!</p>
    <p>Independent spa centres. This will help individual investors generate passive income by building and renting out a high-end apartment in a beautiful place. Or if they want, they can just live there – it’s their own apartment, after all. It’s zero hassle and zero risk. A digitised construction process means we can coordinate it for them and scale this approach easy as pie.</p>
    <p>Office spaces. The needs of teams working in offices change all the time. Engaging an architect every time the requirements change is not practical. Our AI software helps them not only create a space perfectly suited to their needs, but also rearrange it at any time later on.</p>
    <p>Single-family homes. Seems like the easiest one to crack, doesn’t it? But frankly, the one-design-fits-all isn’t catching on yet, at least among my friends and family.</p>
    <h2><a id="our-team"></a>our team <span aria-role="img" class="emoji">❤️</span></h2>
    <p>Even though I’m a single founder right now (Tomek Wiszniewski, <a target="_blank" href="http://architect.codes">architect.codes</a>), I’m extremely lucky to be surrounded by turbo smart and experienced folks interested in Homalive. When the time comes, I’m pretty sure they’ll make amazing co-founders!</p>
